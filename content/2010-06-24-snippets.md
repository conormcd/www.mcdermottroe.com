- [You're Doing It Wrong](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1814327) by
  [Poul-Henning Kamp](http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/) in [ACM
  Queue](http://queue.acm.org/) is worth a read if you're writing any
  performance-critical code. By the same author, the [Notes from the
  Architect](http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/ArchitectNotes) for the [Varnish
  cache](http://www.varnish-cache.org/) is interesting for much the same
  reason.
- I recently re-found ["Have you ever legalized
  marijuana?"](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legalized-marijuana.html)
  by [Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/).  It's a blog post
  (essay?) on complexity that anyone who hands work to programmers should
  read. At the very least it might explain why you hear the word "No" more
  often than you'd like. It's a pity Steve doesn't blog any more, but at least
  all of his old stuff is still available.
- For anyone working on or interested in software used by large numbers of
  people, [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/) is worth a visit. In
  particular, the [Real Life
  Architectures](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example) section is
  worth reading through.
- Finally, in work-related news, [Ross](http://rossduggan.ie/) and I recently
  finished up a long, slow process of [cleaning up the boards.ie
  infrastructure](http://web.archive.org/web/20110812142318/http://blog.boards.ie/2010/05/27/cleaning-up-a-few-years-of-incremental-infrastructure-growth/).
  Our next big challenge is to squeeze some more performance out of the
  software [boards.ie](http://www.boards.ie/) runs on
  ([vBulletin](http://www.vbulletin.com/)). If anyone out there runs a large
  vBulletin installation, [we'd love to
  chat](http://web.archive.org/web/20110824032435/http://blog.boards.ie/2010/06/03/calling-other-big-vbulletin-forums).

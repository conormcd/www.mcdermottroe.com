I was participating in [a
thread](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2055604423) on
[Boards.ie](http://www.boards.ie) recently where the original poster asked the
question:

> [W]hat do I now need to improve on and learn about in order to get any kind of programming/software development job?

As the thread progressed I mentioned [what I'd expect a novice programmer to
know](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=60941239) and [how I used
to go about
interviewing](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=60947575) but the
part that really got me thinking was when I mentioned some books that I have
sitting on my bookshelf. Which ones were good for helping me improve as a
programmer and why? I [answered on the
thread](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=60955924) but I figured
I should expand on my choices here:

[**The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
Master**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/) – It's pretty much a
collection of good advice to programmers who are trying to improve themselves
professionally. Most of the advice is stuff you'll learn sooner or later but
it's worth seeing it written down and in an easily readable form. The authors
have [branched out into publishing](http://www.pragprog.com/) a whole load of
other books (none of which I've read yet) and their podcast.

[**Programming Pearls**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201657880/) – A
collection of small, but tricky problems and really nice worked solutions for
them. The chapters were once articles in the Communications of the ACM and
each one is arranged around a theme with sample problems at the end (there are
solutions at the back of the book). You could think of this book as a sort of
"[Knuth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485419/)-lite". I find reading
it makes me want to open an editor and start cranking out code.

[**Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/) (a.k.a. "the [Gang
of Four](http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/Gang-of-Four.html) book") – A lot of
object-oriented problems seem to reoccur over and over again so it's worth
being able to spot those and know some high-level solutions for them. You get
more out of this book if you read it, work for a year and come back and read
it again. On reading it the 2nd and subsequent times, I've found myself saying
"Ah, that's what I was doing when I implemented X". It's also useful as a
Rosetta Stone for communicating with senior developers who are full of
themselves.

[**The Mythical Man-Month**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959/) –
This is a pretty old collection of essays, but if you look past the antiquated
bits (like punch cards and paper manuals) you'll find a lot of wisdom. It's
more a book on project management than software development but it's well
worth a read, after all every software developer is at least partly a project
manager. File this book under "learn from the mistakes of others".

[**Joel on Software**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590593898/) – I don't
actually own a copy of this, I borrowed it from a friend. All the essays that
make up the book are available on
[http://www.joelonsoftware.com](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) so there's no
need to buy the book unless you feel like supporting the author.  It's a mixed
bag of stuff but it's the collection of thoughts of a successful programmer so
it's worth picking through. Joel helpfully includes a "Top 10" listing on his
blog.  That's a good place to start. Along with [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/) he created [Stack
Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), an excellent programming Q&A site.
The podcast to go with the site is also worth a listen.

Apart from those books, I'd also recommend consuming as many technology blogs
and podcasts as you have time for. Here's a list of blogs and podcasts that I
follow. I don't want to review them, but they may be worth a look:

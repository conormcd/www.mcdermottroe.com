I'm Conor McDermottroe. I'm a software engineer working for
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com). I also shoot [50m prone
rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metre_rifle_prone) for
[Ireland](http://www.targetshooting.ie/) and [Dublin University Rifle
Club](http://www.durifleclub.com/). I don't blog very often, you're more
likely to see new content from me on Twitter or Instagram.

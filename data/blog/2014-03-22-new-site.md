# New site

[description]: # (I've updated www.mcdermottroe.com.)

I finally got around to doing some work on this site. It's been quite a long
time in the making since it's been more of an interesting experiment than a
serious project. The front page should update from
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/91242583@N03/) and
[Instagram](http://instagram.com/irlconor/) so it shouldn't be *quite* as
stagnant as the old site.

The code behind this site is all available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/conormcd/www.mcdermottroe.com) so feel free to
criticise and/or copy anything you find interesting or objectionable. There
aren't any comments on this blog, so feel free to use
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/IRLConor) or [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/conormcd/www.mcdermottroe.com/issues) as
appropriate.

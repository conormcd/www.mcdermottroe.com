# Blogging

According to [Larry Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall), there are
three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience and hubris. I seem
to have a surplus of the first and so have resisted blogging for a long time.
Maybe my impatience and hubris have overtaken the laziness.

This may be the first of many blog posts or I may give up after a few. Either
way, enjoy it while it lasts.

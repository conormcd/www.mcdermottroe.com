# A Programmer's Bookshelf

I was participating in [a
thread](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2055604423) on
[Boards.ie](http://www.boards.ie) recently where the original poster asked the
question:

<blockquote>"[W]hat do I now need to improve on and learn about in order to
get any kind of programming/software development job?"
</blockquote>

As the thread progressed I mentioned [what I'd expect a novice programmer to
know](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=60941239) and [how I used
to go about
interviewing](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=60947575) but the
part that really got me thinking was when I mentioned some books that I have
sitting on my bookshelf. Which ones were good for helping me improve as a
programmer and why? I [answered on the
thread](http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=60955924) but I figured
I should expand on my choices here:

[**The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master**]({{amazonlink:020161622X}})
{{amazonbug:020161622X}} - It's pretty much a collection of good advice to
programmers who are trying to improve themselves professionally. Most of the
advice is stuff you'll learn sooner or later but it's worth seeing it written
down and in an easily readable form. The authors have [branched out into
publishing](http://www.pragprog.com/titles) a whole load of other books (none
of which I've read yet) and their [podcast](http://pragprog.com/podcasts)

[**Programming Pearls**]({{amazonlink:0201657880}})
{{amazonbug:0201657880}} - A collection of small, but tricky problems and
really nice worked solutions for them. The chapters were once articles in the
Communications of the ACM and each one is arranged around a theme with sample
problems at the end (there are solutions at the back of the book). You could
think of this book as a sort of "[Knuth]({{amazonlink:0201485419}})-lite"
{{amazonbug:0201485419}}. I find reading it makes me want to open an editor
and start cranking out code.

[**Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**]({{amazonlink:0201633612}})
{{amazonbug:0201633612}} (a.k.a. "the [Gang of
Four](http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/Gang-of-Four.html) book") - A lot of
object-oriented problems seem to reoccur over and over again so it's worth
being able to spot those and know some high-level solutions for them. You get
more out of this book if you read it, work for a year and come back and read
it again. On reading it the 2nd and subsequent times, I've found myself saying
"Ah, that's what I was doing when I implemented X". It's also useful as a
Rosetta Stone for communicating with senior developers who are full of
themselves.

[**The Mythical Man-Month**]({{amazonlink:0201835959}})
{{amazonbug:0201835959}} - This is a pretty old collection of essays, but if
you look past the antiquated bits (like punch cards and paper manuals) you'll
find a lot of wisdom. It's more a book on project management than software
development but it's well worth a read, after all every software developer is
at least partly a project manager. File this book under "learn from the
mistakes of others".

[**Joel on Software**]({{amazonlink:1590593898}})
{{amazonbug:1590593898}} - I don't actually own a copy of this, I borrowed it
from a friend. All the essays that make up the book are available on
[http://www.joelonsoftware.com](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) so there's no
need to buy the book unless you feel like supporting the author.  It's a mixed
bag of stuff but it's the collection of thoughts of a successful programmer so
it's worth picking through. Joel helpfully includes a "Top 10" listing on his
blog.  That's a good place to start. Along with [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/) he created [Stack
Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), an excellent programming Q&A site.
The [podcast](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=279215411)
to go with the site is also worth a listen.

Apart from those books, I'd also recommend consuming as many
technology blogs and podcasts as you have time for. Here's a list of
blogs and podcasts that I follow. I don't want to review them, but
they may be worth a look:
